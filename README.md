# SRB2 Java Launcher
Small launcher for Sonic Robo Blast 2 made in Java.

## About
This is a small project made in my free time so I can learn more about Java, the Git workflow and GitHub in general. 
Because of this, it's not as feature-complete as other launchers and the code might not be very clean, efficient or anything like that. But hey, it works!
