# Ultimate SRB2 Launcher
Small launcher for Sonic Robo Blast 2 made in Java.

## Installation 
[Download the latest release here.](https://github.com/ThatAwesomeGuy173/ultimate-srb2-launcher/releases) Place the executable in your SRB2 folder then open the program. Simple as that!

## About
This is a small project made with NetBeans in my free time so I can learn more about Java, the Git workflow and GitHub in general. 
Because of this, it's not as feature-complete as other launchers and the code might not be very clean, efficient or anything like thatâ€”but hey, it works!

It's also worth mentioning that every release is wrapped with [launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) to allow for an .exe file extension and an icon change.
